Day 1:-

- we started with docker image.
- successfully created it.
- It was taking lot of time to create an image and it was of big size of approx 700mb
- We read documentation and tried parallaly lot of ways with different version of node.
- finally one solution we found was multi stage building which was promissing
- but after lot of attempts we not able to run the file.

the silly mistage was we missed the missed the one copy layer from one stage to another

then we ran through kubernetes and the pods were working fine 
but the next challenge was to hit on local host url.

Day 2:

we started with manual creation
first we thought it will be easy.
but got lot my configuration confustion.

so tackle that by a very nice plan
we were creating paralley with different configuration and then whoever's is working we followed that config.
we used divide and concur.

Day 3 :-

starting with terrafrom it went smooth.
we didn't faced issue while doing CI/CD, till the image building and pushing to the docker registory.

then challenge start we have to connect EKS cluster to this new image every time.
which we figured in the end that we have to push the image on ECR registory instead of docker hub.
and connect eks and ecr in aws.
